# DevSecOps SDLC Pipeline

![DevSecOps SDLC](https://github.com/shubnimkar/DevSecOps/assets/46809421/def7bd4c-f56e-447f-803d-accb57914c68)

## Objective:

Implement a robust DevSecOps pipeline to ensure secure software development and continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities.

## Tools and Technologies:

1. **Jenkins**: Jenkins serves as the CI/CD orchestration tool, automating the build and deployment processes. It integrates with various security tools to enforce security checks at every stage of the pipeline.

2. **SonarQube**: SonarQube is used for code quality and security scanning. It checks code for vulnerabilities, bugs, and code smells, providing detailed reports and feedback to developers.

3. **Dependency Checker**: Dependency checkers like OWASP Dependency-Check or Snyk can be integrated to scan third-party libraries and components for known vulnerabilities.

4. **TruffleHog**: TruffleHog is a tool for identifying and alerting on secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) committed to source code repositories, helping to prevent data breaches.

5. **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**: OWASP ZAP is a security testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It can be automated to scan for security issues during the CI/CD process.

6. **Grafana**: Grafana is used for monitoring and visualization. You can create dashboards to display metrics related to the DevSecOps pipeline, including security scan results, build statuses, and performance metrics.

7. **Docker**: Docker is utilized for containerization, enabling consistent deployment of applications across different environments and simplifying the management of dependencies.

8. **GitHub**: GitHub serves as the version control system, where code repositories are hosted. You can leverage GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation and integration with various DevSecOps tools.

## DevSecOps Pipeline Stages:

1. **Code Commit (GitHub)**:
   - Developers commit code to the GitHub repository.
   - TruffleHog scans for secrets in the codebase.

2. **Code Build (Jenkins)**:
   - Jenkins triggers a build process.
   - SonarQube scans the code for quality and security issues.
   - Dependency checker scans for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
   - OWASP ZAP performs security testing for web applications.

3. **Artifact Packaging (Docker)**:
   - Code is packaged into Docker containers, ensuring consistent environments.

4. **Deployment (Jenkins)**:
   - Automated deployment of the Docker containers to staging or production environments.

5. **Monitoring (Grafana)**:
   - Grafana dashboards display real-time information on pipeline status, security scan results, and application performance.

6. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Ongoing monitoring and periodic security scans for vulnerabilities in production using the same DevSecOps toolset.
   - Alerts are triggered for critical security findings.

## Benefits:
- Early identification and mitigation of security vulnerabilities.
- Improved code quality and maintainability.
- Consistent and automated deployments using Docker containers.
- Real-time visibility into the pipeline's status and security posture.
